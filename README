This project is containing bumblebee (Formerly known as prime-ng)..

bumblebee is Optimus support for Linux, with real offloading, and not
switchable graphics.. More important.. it works on Optimus Laptops without a
graphical multiplexer..

Bumblebee Supports: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, OpenSuSE and Fedora. More
are coming.

The Installation should now be completely automatic...

First of all: If you have any problem... please create a bug report package
with the bumblebee-bugreport tool..

Then create an issue on github...

This project have had great succes and I need to have a way to easily manage
support problems..


Now 3D is enabled on both the Intel and the nVidia at the same time..

The Intel card is running the Desktop and the nVidia card can be used for
the thougher applications with the command "optirun32 <application>" or
"optirun64 <application>"...

So now we just need somebody to write an application for automatically
balance which applications should be run on which card.. 

Support for automatically shutting down and starting up the nVidia card has
been added in version 1.4.20 for Ubuntu. Other distributions are in
progress.

The nVidia card WILL be draining battery unless the two scripts:
/usr/local/bin/bumblebee-enablecard and /usr/local/bin/bumblebee-disablecard
are configured correctly..."

But still I think it is a good step forward...

There are several ways to start using bumblebee:

Download the .zip or .tar.gz by clicking the 'Downloads' button on the
'Source' page to a directory of your liking. Unzip or untar and run the install
script with 'sudo ./install.sh' (or 'sudo -E ./install.sh' on Fedora)

Go to the directory of your liking and:
1. git clone http://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee.git
2. cd bumblebee/
3. sudo ./install.sh (or 'sudo -E ./install.sh' on Fedora)

(The second method makes it easier to regularly update bumblebee if you're
willing to invest a little bit of time in working with git.)

I left the old releases up there in the old/ folder.. if someone needs it..
