The Installation should now be completely automatic...

First of all: If you have any problem... please create a bug report package
with the bumblebee-bugreport tool..

Then create an issue on github...

This project have had great succes and I need to have a way to easily manage
support problems..


Now 3D is enabled on both the Intel and the nVidia at the same time..

The Intel card is running the Desktop and the nVidia card can be used for
the thougher applications with the command "optirun32 <application>" or
"optirun64 <application>"...

Support for automatically shutting down and starting up the nVidia card is
in developpement.

There are several ways to start using bumblebee :

Download the .zip or .tar.gz by clicking the 'Downloads' button on the
'Source' page to a directory of your liking. Unzip or untar and run the install
script with 'sudo ./install.sh' (or 'sudo -E ./install.sh' on Fedora)

Go to the directory of your liking and:
1. git clone http://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee.git
2. cd bumblebee/
3. sudo ./install.sh (or 'sudo -E ./install.sh' on Fedora)

(The second method makes it easier to regularly update bumblebee if you're
willing to invest a little bit of time in working with git.)
