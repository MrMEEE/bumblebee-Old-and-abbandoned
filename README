This is a Nouveau implementation of Bumblebee.
Currently this is tested on ArchLinux distribution but the install/uninstall
scripts should work for any distribution. An AUR package should be released 
shortly.

To test Bumblebee nouveauyou will need:
- Needed packages and software:
     * This was tested on kernel 2.6.39 unpatched, 2.6.38 should work as well. 
       Any newer kernel is expected to work. Make sure it was compiled with the 
       'CONFIG_VGA_SWITCHEROO=y'
     * For 3d acceleration you will need the nouveau 'dri' + Gallium3D drivers,
       'libgl' and 'mesa'. In ArchLinux they are available under the 'extra' 
       repository (nouveau-dri, libgl and mesa).
     * VirtualGL software (For Arch users is available in the AUR)
- You must enable the debugfs filesystem, see:
     https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bumblebee#Power_Switching_Using_Vga-switcheroo
     on information how to do it.
- You will need Mesa demos and tools to test Bumblebee nouveau working.


Install:
$ git clone -b nouveau git://github.com/Samsagax/bumblebee.git
$ cd bumblebee
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ sudo sh ./install.sh

To test it:
$ sudo optirun glxgears

To uninstall:
$ chmod +x uninstall.sh
$ sudo sh ./uninstall.sh


Almost no configuration is needed. If vga-switcheroo is able to find the 
correct DSM method to handle your nVidia card, then you are capable of using
power management safely and seamlessly.
